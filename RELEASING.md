### Releasing the SDK
1. Update CHANGELOG.md to reflect the changes done since the last release.
    A draft can be generated by running `./draft_release_notes.sh` this will fetch the commits since the last release and place them in CHANGELOG.md with the next version.
    Please ensure that this version number matches the one you want to release.
2. Create a PR to master with the name "RELEASE \<major.minor.patch\>"
3. Once the PR has been merged, you should head over to the [releases page](https://github.schibsted.io/spt-identity/identity-sdk-android/releases) in the repository and "draft a new release"
4. Enter all the following fields and publish release
    - Tag version: The version you are releasing in the format "v&lt;major&gt;.&lt;minor&gt;.&lt;patch&gt;", example v2.5.17
    - Release title: Should be in the format "v&lt;major&gt;.&lt;minor&gt;.&lt;patch&gt; Codename (year-month-date)", example "v0.4.0 Archimonde (2017-10-25)". Codename changes for minor version changes, but not patches and should change alphabetically.
    - Description: A list of changes since the last release, as written in the release notes. Should be in the same format as the changelog.

The release will be published as soon as the travis build for the tag with the version number completes.
